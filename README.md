Description:

I started this website off by creating three html files - one for the About Me page, the Contact page, and my Portfolio page. I then added my Bootstrap links and JavaScript links to all three and added my navigation bar at the top of the pages. I made sure the Navbar was consistent on all three with navigation links to take you to the correct page. I then began to set up each body element with semantic tags like nav, main, form, and footer. I used columns and rows to set up my webpages for responsive delivery. When the screen gets smaller, eveything starts to move so you're still able to see all of the content and pictures with a different layout. I added social media links to my contact page and different effects to all of my buttons and pictures. I added a sticky footer to the bottom of every page. I organized all of my code so the layout is easy to read and easy to find anything you may need. I made multiple commits throughout the entire process with detailed comments of what I had done/changed.
