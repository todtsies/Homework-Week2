                My name is Emily. I grew up in central Virginia in a small town
                called Buckingham County. I graduated from Buckingham County
                High School in 2016 as 9th in my class. I participated in
                Governor's School, which allowed me to graduate from high school
                with my Associate's Degree. Out of high school I went to
                Virginia Tech, where I was majoring in Biological Sciences.
                After a year there, I realized that's not what I wanted to do
                with my life. Still unsure with what I wanted to do and not
                wanting to waste thousands of dollars, I moved back home and
                figured I'd get some perspective from the real working world. I
                began waiting tables and realized I loved working with people
                from all backgrounds. That's what made it fun! Now I work at a
                doggie daycare, which is the best job I've ever had. I'm able to
                take my dogs with my to work everyday! Who wouldn't love that?!
              </p>
              <p>
                I was a tomboy as a child and absolutely loved to be outdoors. I
                played softball from the age of 9 to 18 and played the position
                of second base or short stop. I also played volleyball, I was a
                cheerleader and ran cross-country all four years of high school.
                I was apart of many clubs and associations in high school, like
                the National Honors Society, Beta Club, Ecology Club, Student
                Council Association, and more! I loved being involved in high
                school and plan to do the same in my career. Growing up, my
                family bred Labrador Retrievers. I think this is where my love
                for dogs came from. I have three dogs - one German Shepherd, one
                German Shorthaired Pointer, and one Siberian Husky. Their names
                are Titan, Voodoo, and Yeti. Yeti - the Siberian Husky - is a
                rescue that I met through my job at the doggie daycare. The
                previous owner was going to surrender him due to her financial
                situation. I knew him and my dogs got along great so I offered
                to take him in. It was the best decision I've made in a long
                time!
